# PCA-Portfolio-Optimizer

## Overview
This project applies PCA to portfolio optimization, reducing the dimensionality of asset returns to identify key factors.  The optimized portfolios outperform standard benchmarks by maximizing returns and minimizing variance.
## Features

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces dimensionality of asset returns data, focusing on key components that drive portfolio performance.
- **Portfolio Construction**: Utilizes PCA-transformed data to build portfolios optimized for variance and returns.
- **Benchmark Comparison**: Compares the optimized portfolio's performance against benchmarks, such as an equally weighted portfolio.
